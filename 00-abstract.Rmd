Ecosystem transformations are likely to become more common with accelerating global change and are very difficult to reverse. Often the novel systems that result are maintained by stabilizing feedbacks that are driven by external or internal drivers. Increasing our understanding of the components of these feedbacks and how the feedback components relate to each other is crucial to know when they can be reversed and the original ecosystem restored. Here, we conducted four studies that aimed to disentangle positive feedback mechanisms that maintain alternative species assemblages in the sagebrush shrublands of the Western United States. \par

In chapter one we found that the spatial connectivity of fuel influences the burn severity of fire, which then favors the occurrence of fire-tolerant invasive annuals in the seedbank. In chapter two we investigated how invasion and the loss of shrubs and perennial grasses by fire influenced soil nutrient cycling, and found that the annual grass dominance in the post-fire state converted the system from a source to a sink of soil C and N. In chapter three, we constructed a fire history chronosequence to isolate the effect of time since fire and remove the effect of repeated fires. We found that there was very little evidence of recovery towards the pre-fire state even after 30 years. Rather, we found evidence that livestock grazing and annual grass abundance maintain the post-fire grass-dominated state. Finally, in chapter four we created an allometric equation to calculate biomass from cover estimates.  \par
