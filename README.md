My dissertation. Fully done in R Markdown. There were some formatting issues I could not figure out, thus two seperate files: `dissertation_title.Rmd`, which is the title page only, and `dissertation_mahood.Rmd` which is the rest of the dissertation. `make_dissertation.R` combines the two files together to output `full_dissertation.pdf`
