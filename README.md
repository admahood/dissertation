# dissertation

My dissertation. Fully done in R Markdown. There were some formatting issues I could not figure out, thus two seperate files: dissertation_title.*, which is the title page only, and dissertation_mahood.* which is the rest of the dissertation. make_dissertation.R combines the two files together to output full_dissertation.pdf
